# Ping Pong Arcade Game

A simple two-player **Ping Pong arcade game** built in **Python** using the **Pygame** framework.  
This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as **real-time game loops**, **collision detection**, **keyboard input handling**, and **object-based game design**.

Beginner-friendly and ideal for learning how 2D games work internally.
